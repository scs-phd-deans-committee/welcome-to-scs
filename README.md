## Black Friday

Black Friday, the formal PhD progress review at the end of each semester, has had an aura of mystery in the past. Unfortunately, this intruige has led to anxiety and mismatched expectations, with little prior documentation available for students to compare experiences.

This summer, we worked with the Dean's Office to assemble two complementary documents that paint a more vibrant picture of Black Friday. We're pleased to share this pair of documents that describes Black Friday from the perspective of the SCS faculty and the PhD students.
